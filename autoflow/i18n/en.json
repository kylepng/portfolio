  "faq_q1": "Why are my prompts failing?",
  "faq_a1": "Policy violations are the most common cause. Some content types are restricted by Google Flow's content policy. Try rephrasing your prompt to avoid potentially flagged terms. Also check that your prompts don't exceed the character limit.",
  "faq_q2": "Why is the gallery empty?",
  "faq_a2": "Make sure you're on a Google Flow project page (labs.google.com/fx/), then click the <strong>Scan All</strong> button. Images auto-populate during generation, but Scan All will pick up any that were missed.",
  "faq_q3": "Can I use Auto Flow on multiple devices?",
  "faq_a3": "Yes, with Pro. Your subscription is linked to your email account, so you can sign in on any device. Free tier usage is tracked per device.",
  "faq_q4": "What's the ||| delimiter?",
  "faq_a4": "The ||| delimiter separates image prompts from video prompts in the Image \u2192 Video workflow. Everything before it describes the still image to generate, and everything after describes how to animate it.",
  "faq_q5": "Why is 4K download slow?",
  "faq_a5": "Veo serializes upscaling \u2014 only one video upscales at a time on Google's end. This is a platform limitation, not an Auto Flow issue. 720p downloads are instant since no upscaling is needed.",
  "faq_q6": "The extension isn't detecting the Flow page",
  "faq_a6": "Make sure you're on labs.google.com/fx/ and the Chrome sidepanel is open. Try refreshing the page. If the issue persists, disable and re-enable the extension in chrome://extensions.",
  "faq_q7": "How do I get Pro?",
  "faq_a7": "Open the Subscription section in Settings, sign in with your email (you'll receive a magic link), then click Upgrade. Your Pro access activates immediately.",
  "faq_q8": "What's humanized mode?",
  "faq_a8": "Humanized mode adds random delays between actions (800\u20133000ms) to simulate natural browsing behavior. Adjust the speed with the slider \u2014 lower values mean longer delays. Useful if you're experiencing rate limiting.",
